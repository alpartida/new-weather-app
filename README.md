# New Weather App created with Javascript

This weather app I created during my second coding workshop of SheCodes. I created it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also added Bootstrap to help with some of the CSS styling. It was my final submission project for  workshop number two of SheCodes.

## Requirements

The final submission had requirements for code to be valid. They were as follows, Search engine, API integration, unit conversion, wind speed, precipitation, weather description, and weather icon are mandatory. The forecast was optional but everything thatâ€™s visible should be fully working (no fake data).
